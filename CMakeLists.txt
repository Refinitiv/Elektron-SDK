cmake_minimum_required (VERSION 3.10.3)
# The minimum version was chosen from a combination of the need for
# critical bug fixes by CMake, the idea of taking advantage of future
# CMake fixes soon to be released and wanting to fully embrace the
# target oriented CMake build framework.  It may be possible to change
# the minimum required version to an earlier version, but there is no
# guarantee of a successful build if changed.
