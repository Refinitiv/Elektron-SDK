This is the change log of the Elektron-SDK (ESDK) for Java. ESDK consists of both the 
Elektron Message API (EMA) and the Elektron Transport API (ETA). This file contains history 
starting from ESDK 1.2.0 which is when all components (EMA C++, EMA Java, ETA C, ETA Java) 
of ESDK were fully open sourced. Note that ESDK version numbers start from 1.2.0 and 
EMA/ETA version numbers start from 3.2.0.

There are three types of ESDK releases that append a letter directly followed by a 
number to the version number. 

"L" releases (e.g., 1.2.0.L1) are full ESDK releases that are uploaded to 
    Customer Zone, Developer Community and GitHub. 
"G" releases (e.g., 1.2.0.G1) are releases that are only uploaded to GitHub. 
"E" releases (E-Loads) are emergency ESDK releases that are uploaded to 
    Customer Zone and Developer Community but not to GitHub.
    Also note that emergency releases may only be partial (i.e., Java or C++/C only).
