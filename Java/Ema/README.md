# Elektron Message API (EMA) Java Edition

The Elektron Message API: This is an easy-to-use, performant, open source message layer API. The Elektron Message API helps developers by allowing them to develop applications with significantly less code. It is new and will be enhanced by collaboration with customers (through GitHub) and Thomson Reuters based on customer feedback.

EMA is written on top of the Elektron Transport API (ETA) utilizing the Value Added Reactor and Watchlist.

# EMA Features and Functionality

## Common Features:

- TCP/IP Connectivity

- Component Versioning: This feature sends information about itself to the connected component.

- RMTES Decoder	EMA provides a built in RMTES decoder. If desired, application may cache RmtesBuffer objects and apply all the received changes to them.

- Data::toString()	All OMM containers, primitives and messages may simply be printed out to screen in a standardized output format. 

- Data::asHex()	Applications may obtain binary representations of all OMM containers, primitives and messages.

- File Config:	Enables applications to specify EMA configuration in an      EmaConfig.xml file

- Direct Write setting on socket channel

- High Water Mark setting on socket channel
		
- Removing one deprecation. Now reconnectAttemptLimit,reconnectMinDelay,reconnectMaxDelay,xmlTraceEnable,MsgKeyInUpdates only can be configured
  on Consumer/IProvider/NiProvider instance level.
	
## Consumer Features:
- Default Admin Domain Requests: EMA uses default login, directory and dictionary request while connecting to server. This provides minimum configuration for applications to get up and running.   

- Connection Failover: EMA can be configured to specify a list of failover servers via ChannelSet configuration.  In the event that the consumer's connection attempt fails, EMA will utilize the next channel in the ChannelSet list.

- Configurable Admin Domain Requests:  EMA provides means for modifying the default admin domain requests

- Batch Request: Application may use a single request message to specify interest in multiple items via the item list

- Dynamic View:	Application may specify a subset of fields or elements of a particular item

- Optimized Pause and Resume: Application may request server to pause and resume item stream

- Single Open: EMA supports application selected single open functionality

- Programmatic Config: Enables application to programmatically specify and overwrite EMA configuration

## Non-Interactive Provider Features:

- Default Admin Domains: EMA uses default login and directory messages while connecting to server. This provides minimum configuration for applications to get up and running.

- Configurable Admin Domains: EMA provides means for modifying the default admin domain messages. 		

- Programmatic Config: Enables application to programmatically specify and overwrite EMA configuration

## Interactive Provider Features:

- Default Admin Domains: EMA uses default directory messages while sending to the connected client. This provides minimum configuration for applications to get up and running.
 
- Configurable Admin Domains:  EMA provides means for modifying the default admin domain messages. 

- Programmatic Config	Enables application to programmatically specify and overwrite EMA configuration
