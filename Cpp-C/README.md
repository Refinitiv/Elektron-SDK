# Elektron SDK - C/C++ Edition
This is the Elektron SDK. This SDK is an all encompassing package of all Elektron APIs. This currently includes the Elektron Message API (EMA) and the Elektron Transport API (ETA).

The **Elektron Message API (EMA)** is an ease of use, open source, OMM API. EMA is designed to provide clients rapid development of applications, minimizing lines of code and providing a broad range of flexibility. It provides flexible configuration with default values to simplify use and deployment. EMA is written on top of the Elektron Transport API (ETA) utilizing the Value Added Reactor and Watchlist.

The **Elektron Transport API (ETA)** is the re-branded Ultra Performance API (UPA). ETA is an open source Thomson Reuters low-level Transport and OMM encoder/decoder API. It is used by the Thomson Reuters Enterprise Platform for Real Time and Elektron for the optimal distribution of OMM/RWF data and allows applications to achieve the highest performance, highest throughput, and lowest latency. ETA fully supports all OMM constructs and messages.

# Documentation

Please refer to top level README.md and to Cpp-C/Eta/README.MD or Cpp-C/Ema/README.MD files to find more information. Sections Cpp-C/Eta/Docs/ and Cpp-C/Ema/Docs contain PDF/HTML documentation. In current directory, please find the test plan with test results: ESDK-C-Edition\_Test\_Plan.xlsx

# Installation and Build

Please refer to Installation Guides located in Cpp-C/Eta/Docs and Cpp-C/Ema/Docs for detailed instructions. In this section are some basic details.

## Install ESDK 
There are 3 ways to install Eletron SDK:

Obtain the source **from this repository**. It will contain all of the required source to build ESDK as detailed below. In addition, this repository depends on the [Elektron-SDK-BinaryPack](http://www.github.com/Refinitiv/Elektron-SDK-BinaryPack) repository and pulls the ETA libraries from that location. The BinaryPack contains libraries for the closed source portions of the product, permitting users to build and link all dependent libraries to have a fully functional product. 

Elektron SDK package may also be [downloaded from Refinitiv Developer Portal](https://developers.refinitiv.com/elektron/elektron-sdk-cc/downloads).

Elektron SDK package is also available on [Customer Zone](https://customers.reuters.com/a/technicalsupport/softwaredownloads.aspx). 

- Category: "MDS - API"
- Product: "Elektron SDK"

## Building ESDK

**Using CMake**:

Cmake is required to create the Linux Makefile files and Windows Solution and vcxproj files. To build examples or re-build libraies, user must download [CMake](https://cmake.org).

Refer to the ESDK C/C++ Installation Guide located in Cpp-C/Eta/Docs or Cpp-C/Ema/Docs for more detailed CMake build instructions than what is described below.

**For Linux**:

At the same directory level as the resulting Elektron-SDK directory, issue the following command to build the optimized Makefile files:

	cmake -HElektron-SDK -Bbuild-esdk
	# Elektron-SDK is the ESDK directory 
	# build-esdk is the directory where all build output is placed 
	# Note: build-esdk is automatically created

Issue the following command to build debug Makefile files:

	cmake -HElektron-SDK -Bbuild-esdk â€“DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug

The cmake command builds all needed Makefile files (and related dependencies) in the build-esdk directory. 
Go to the build-esdk directory and type "make" to create the ESDK libraries. Note that the libraries are sent to the Elektron-SDK directory (i.e., not the build-esdk directory).

**For Windows**:

At the same directory level as the resulting Elektron-SDK directory, issue the following command to build the Solution and vcxproj files:

	cmake -HElektron-SDK -Bbuild-esdk -G "VisualStudioVersion"
	# Elektron-SDK is the ESDK directory with the source code 
	# build-esdk is the directory where all build output is placed; this is where the built binaries are placed 
	# Note: build-esdk is automatically created
	# "VisualStudioVersion" is the visual studio version to use for build on windows (e.g., "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64")
	# Note: A list of visual studio versions can be obtained by typing "cmake -help". 

The cmake command builds all needed Solution and vcxproj files (and other related files) in the build-esdk directory. User must open these files and build all libraries and examples in the same manner as with prior ESDK versions. Note that the build output is sent to the Elektron-SDK directory (i.e., not the build-esdk directory).

Note that only the following Windows compilers are supported.

- Visual Studio 15 2017
- Visual Studio 14 2015
- Visual Studio 12 2013
- Visual Studio 11 2012

**32 bit support**:

CMake has build support for 32 bit platforms.

Linux: Add "-DBUILD\_32\_BIT\_ETA=ON" to the cmake build

Windows: Do not add "Win64" to the "VisualStudioVersion".  Example, When specifying, "Visual Studio 14 2015", for a 64-bit build it would be "Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64". For a 32-bit build, it would be "Visual Studio 14 2015"
